## 1 Introduction

In this last assignment, our group looked at creating test suites for two classes: DataUtilities and Range, and these test suites were created using black box testing methods, as we had no access to the internal structure or source code of these classes. 

For assignment 3, we were introduced to the importance of coverage when it comes to our test suites. Understanding, as well as measuring how well our test cases cover the code in the classes provided is an important feature to take into account when testing the behavior of a system, as it gauges an understanding of what our system is actually doing when we execute these tests.

Through this assignment, this idea of code coverage was approached by using different metrics of measuring coverage, whether it be statement, branch/decision, condition or method coverage.

# For DataUtilities.calculateColumnTotal:

In order to calculate the DU-pair coverage for the method calculateColumnTotal() in class DataUtilities, I did the following:
